Procedure to make safe the Hydrogen locomotive for indoor maintenance requirements.

To ensure employee exposure to hazards associated with the hydrogen locomotive are mitigated the following must occur. The unit pressure is dropped to a point where total release of hydrogen will not cause the surpassing of the lower explosive limit for a space.

Manifold purge:
Prior to bringing the unit under roof drop the pressure of the tanks to 10 Bar. Close the tank valves using the HMI and purge remaining H2 from the manifold. 

Area Inspection:
Confirm location(s) of fire extinguisher(s) and ensure that there is at least one hydrogen rated portable fire extinguisher near the hydrogen equipment. Per NFPA 2, a portable fire extinguisher having a rating of not less than 4-A: 80-B:C shall be provided at the work area in approved locations not more than 50 ft. away. The fire extinguishers shall installed, inspected, and maintained as required by NFPA 10. Information to the rating of the extinguisher is on the label.

Leak Survey: 
Prior to conducting any hot work on or near the unit, a leak survey shall be conducted of the work area of all hydrogen containing equipment within a 25-foot radius. Ensure there are no electronic devices within the leak survey area (intrinsically safe electronics allowed – Class I, Division 1, or Division 2). Unclassified electronics shall be kept 15 feet from the work area until the completion of the leak survey. The portable hydrogen leak detector shall not be considered a hazardous electronic device. 

Atmospheric Monitoring (Tester); Portable Hydrogen Leak Detector: 
The primary device for conducting the leak survey is the portable hydrogen leak detector. The portable 
hydrogen leak detector shall not be the same device that is worn on the body for a personal alarm. The 
gas detector shall be a device that has a handheld probe that can be moved into areas to take a direct 
sample of the air composition in and around hydrogen equipment. The hydrogen gas leak survey shall be conducted by a trained worker on the portable hydrogen leak detector, hydrogen gas and its properties, and the safe egress in case of a hydrogen gas air concentration approaching or exceeding the lower explosive limit (LEL). For more information, please reference the Hydrogen Information Sheet on the next page. 
Hydrogen Leak Survey Parameters: 
While conducting the leak survey, one employee shall operate the portable hydrogen leak detector, while another employee observes that at minimum, the entirety of the work area with hydrogen containing equipment has been surveyed. The operator of the portable hydrogen leak detector shall pause at each leak detection investigation point for a minimum of 5 seconds, or at the minimum recommended time by the manufacturer’s instructions, whichever is greater. 

Special attention shall be taken by the leak surveyor with the sensor probe to: 
•	Hydrogen dispensing hoses 
•	Valves – handle, stem, seat, flanges 
•	Vents (if any present) 
•	Storage vessels 
•	Hydrogen hoses – end connections 
•	Pressure gauges 
•	Capped or closed hydrogen piping or equipment connections 
Any equipment malfunction or continual error output by the hydrogen leak detector shall require a 
replacement of the device before a hot work permit is issued. No hot work shall be conducted within 25 
feet of a hydrogen containing device without a successful leak detection sweep of the work area.

Hydrogen Leak Survey Procedures:
1.	Ensure meter is properly calibrated and bump tested prior to use.
2.	Slowly walk around the unit with the meter and if the meter detects any H2 stop in that area for an accurate reading. 
a.	Check the locomotive battery compartments by sticking the meter in the air vent being careful not to contact the battery terminals. 
b.	Check the traction battery vents on both sides.
c.	Check the fill valves and piping.
3.	Check the cab and from the Engineer side running board scan all the way to the back of the locomotive, access the forward tank manifold and sweep for Hydrogen at low, mid, and high levels.
4.	Access the vent valve locker and check around the valves and piping. And sweep above the tank skid.
5.	Dismount and remount to check the Conductor side running board.
6.	Open the Conductor side forward most carbody door and check around valve H2PRGE-A, and associated piping.
7.	Check around both fuel cells and piping
8.	Complete the leak survey sheet and place in the cab clipboard.
